# ofxDlib


## Description

An [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) wrapper for [dlib](http://dlib.net/).

## Features

-   Toll-free `openFrameworks` ↔ `dlib` bridges using `dlib` `dlib/generic_image.h` interface.
-   `openFrameworks` ↔ `dlib` type conversions.
-   `dlib` helper functions.

## Getting Started

### TL;DR
-   From the `scripts/` directory ...
    -   `./bootstrap.sh`
-   From the `example_dlib_3d_point_cloud/` directory ...
    -   `make && make run`

For performance, run in RELEASE mode. Running in DEBUG mode is _significantly_ slower. For more see [http://dlib.net/faq.html#Whyisdlibslow](http://dlib.net/faq.html#Whyisdlibslow).

## Compatibility

**Currently NOT Compatible with < 0.10.0, thus we have no stable branch as noted below.**
~~The `stable` branch of this repository is meant to be compatible with the openFrameworks [stable branch](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/stable), which corresponds to the latest official openFrameworks release.~~

The `master` branch of this repository is meant to be compatible with the openFrameworks [master branch](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master).

Some past openFrameworks releases are supported via tagged versions, but only `stable` and `master` branches are actively supported.

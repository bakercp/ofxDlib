    // 10000 images.  Each image is labeled so that we know what hand written digit is
    // depicted.  These next statements load the dataset into memory.

    // Now let's define the LeNet.  Broadly speaking, there are 3 parts to a network
    // definition.  The loss layer, a bunch of computational layers, and then an input
    // layer.  You can see these components in the network definition below.
    //
    // The input layer here says the network expects to be given matrix<unsigned char>
    // objects as input.  In general, you can use any dlib image or matrix type here, or
    // even define your own types by creating custom input layers.
    //
    // Then the middle layers define the computation the network will do to transform the
    // input into whatever we want.  Here we run the image through multiple convolutions,
    // ReLU units, max pooling operations, and then finally a fully connected layer that
    // converts the whole thing into just 10 numbers.
    //
    // Finally, the loss layer defines the relationship between the network outputs, our 10
    // numbers, and the labels in our dataset.  Since we selected loss_multiclass_log it
    // means we want to do multiclass classification with our network.   Moreover, the
    // number of network outputs (i.e. 10) is the number of possible labels.  Whichever
    // network output is largest is the predicted label.  So for example, if the first
    // network output is largest then the predicted digit is 0, if the last network output
    // is largest then the predicted digit is 9.

    // fully connected layer with 84 outputs, then apply ReLU.  Similarly, a block of
    // dlib::max_pool<2,2,2,2,dlib::relu<dlib::con<16,5,5,1,1,SUBNET>>> means we apply 16 convolutions with a
    // 5x5 filter size and 1x1 stride to the output of a subnetwork, then apply ReLU, then

    // a file named "mnist_sync" every 20 seconds.  This way, if we kill this program and
    // start it again it will begin where it left off rather than restarting the training
    // from scratch.  This is because, when the program restarts, this call to
    // set_synchronization_file() will automatically reload the settings from mnist_sync if
    // the file exists.

    // Finally, this line begins training.  By default, it runs SGD with our specified
    // learning rate until the loss stops decreasing.  Then it reduces the learning rate by
    // a factor of 10 and continues running until the loss stops decreasing again.  It will
    // keep doing this until the learning rate has dropped below the min learning rate
    // defined above or the maximum number of epochs as been executed (defaulted to 10000).
    trainer.train(training_images, training_labels);

    // At this point our net object should have learned how to classify MNIST images.  But
    // before we try it out let's save it to disk.  Note that, since the trainer has been
    // running images through the network, net will have a bunch of state in it related to
    // the last batch of images it processed (e.g. outputs from each layer).  Since we
    // don't care about saving that kind of stuff to disk we can tell the network to forget
    // about that kind of transient data so that our file will be smaller.  We do this by
